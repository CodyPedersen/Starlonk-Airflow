- Had to manually specify persistent volumes since baremetal clusters can't dynamically provision
- Had to run `sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /<mount folder>` for bitnami pg
- Not deleting all volumes leads to problems on rerun, will need to fix this
- coredns not resolving services (in non-default namespace)
