## Baremetal Cluster
    # Had to manually specify persistent volumes since baremetal clusters can't dynamically provision
    # Had to run `sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /<mount folder>` for bitnami pg
    # Not deleting all volumes leads to problems on rerun, will need to fix this
    # coredns not resolving services (in non-default namespace)
    #   - Reverted to default namespace as a temporary fix until I can dig into why it's referencing 
    # airflow-postgres.default instead of airflow-postgres.airflow
    # - Had to chmod rwx and allow all user/group access to mount directory


    # Current workarounds/methods. Instead of just publicly exposing all the databases for my convenience,
    #   for webserver, just ssh tunnel and set up a localhost proxy on firefox
    #       ssh -D 1110 -p 42069 enso@shivaserv
    #   for airflow postgres, redis, ... set up a pipe to the desired port
    #       ncat -k -l 6379 < redis_pipe | ncat 10.109.148.238 6379 > redis_pipe &
    #       redis-cli -h 192.168.254.14 -p 6379 -a <secret>


# Minikube (M1 - Apple Silicon)
    # `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` before building airflow image
    # Change manifest for bitnami to run as root.
    # Create an init container *busybox* to modify docker volume chown
    # To do: update kube secrets/cm to point to my a different db address
