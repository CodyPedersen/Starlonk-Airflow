- Had to manually specify persistent volumes since baremetal clusters can't dynamically provision
- Had to run `sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /<mount folder>` for bitnami pg
- Not deleting all volumes leads to problems on rerun, will need to fix this
- coredns not resolving services (in non-default namespace)
    - Reverted to default namespace as a temporary fix until I can dig into why it's referencing airflow-postgres.default instead of airflow-postgres.airflow
- Had to chmod rwx and allow all user/group access to mount directory


To do:
    - Set up postgres db connection details (kube secret) and access them in the databases.py code
    - build a custom image with the python libraries referenced, push that to the CR
    - redeploy airflow kube
